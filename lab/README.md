# Lab Instructions

Welcome to the Interactive Keyboard Accessibility Lab! Follow these instructions to get the most out of your learning experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open the lab:**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - No server setup required - all demos work with file:// URLs

2. **Navigate with keyboard only:**
   - Use `Tab` to move between interactive elements
   - Use `Enter` or `Space` to activate buttons
   - Use arrow keys within dropdowns/select elements
   - **Important**: Try navigating with keyboard throughout the entire experience!

## 📖 How This Lab Works

This lab uses **interactive demonstrations** to help you experience accessibility barriers and solutions firsthand. Each demo is embedded in an iframe to isolate problematic code from the main page navigation.

## 💡 Lab Tips

- **Focus on the experience**: Pay attention to how you feel when navigating the broken examples vs the accessible ones
- **Try different interactions**: Don't just tab through - try Enter, Space, right-clicking, Ctrl+clicking
- **Notice the details**: Look for focus indicators, logical flow, and semantic meaning
- **Take your time**: The goal is understanding, not speed

## 🔍 What to Look For

As you go through each demo, ask yourself:
- Can I reach all interactive elements with the keyboard?
- Can I see where I am when navigating?
- Does the navigation flow make sense?
- Do the elements behave as expected?

## 🌟 Remember

This is about building empathy and understanding. Every frustration you experience in the broken examples is something real users face daily on inaccessible websites.
