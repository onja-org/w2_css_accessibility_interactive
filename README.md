# Interactive Keyboard Accessibility Lab

Experience the difference that keyboard-friendly design makes through hands-on interactive demos.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you'll be able to:
- Understand why keyboard accessibility matters for real users
- Identify the difference between real and fake interactive elements
- Recognize the importance of visible focus indicators
- Experience how broken tab order affects navigation
- Apply keyboard accessibility principles to your own projects

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate
**30 minutes** - This is a reading and interaction lab, not a coding lab.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   jj git clone <repository-url>
   cd w2_css_accessibility_interactive
   ```

2. **Open the lab:**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - No server setup required - all demos work with file:// URLs

3. **Navigate with keyboard only:**
   - Use `Tab` to move between interactive elements
   - Use `Enter` or `Space` to activate buttons
   - Use arrow keys within dropdowns/select elements
   - Try this throughout the entire lab experience!

## üìñ How This Lab Works

This lab uses **interactive demonstrations** to help you experience accessibility barriers and solutions firsthand. Each demo is embedded in an iframe to isolate problematic code from the main page navigation.

### What You'll Experience:

1. **Real vs Fake Buttons** - Feel the frustration of elements that look clickable but aren't keyboard accessible
2. **Focus Indicators** - Navigate "blind" vs with clear visual indicators
3. **Tab Order Chaos** - Experience unpredictable navigation vs logical flow

### Navigation Tips:
- **Main page navigation** - Use the blue navigation bar to jump between sections
- **Within demos** - Tab into each iframe to interact with the examples
- **Comparison** - Side-by-side demos let you immediately compare broken vs accessible versions

## üîç What to Pay Attention To

As you go through each demo, notice:
- **Which elements can you reach with Tab?**
- **Can you tell where you are when navigating?**
- **Does the navigation flow match your expectations?**
- **How would this feel if you relied on keyboard navigation daily?**

## üí° Key Concepts

- **Semantic HTML** - Using proper elements (`<button>` not `<div>`)
- **Focus Management** - Making sure users can see where they are
- **Logical Tab Order** - Navigation that follows visual layout
- **User Empathy** - Understanding real impact on people's lives

## üéì After This Lab

Apply these principles to your own projects:
1. **Test with keyboard only** - If you can't use it with Tab/Enter, neither can many users
2. **Use semantic HTML elements** - They come with accessibility features built-in  
3. **Make focus visible** - Don't remove outlines without providing alternatives
4. **Keep tab order logical** - Avoid manual tabindex unless absolutely necessary

## üåü Remember

Accessibility isn't a nice-to-have feature - it's a fundamental requirement for inclusive web development. Every user deserves to access and interact with your content.
